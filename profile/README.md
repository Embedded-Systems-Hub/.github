## 🗺️ Embedded Roadmap Program

**[Basic Level](https://github.com/Embedded-Systems-Hub/EMBEDDED-ROADMAP-Basic)**

<img width="500" height="630" alt="EMBEDDED-ROADMAP-Basic" src="https://github.com/Embedded-Systems-Hub/.github/blob/main/assets/embedded-roadmap-basic.png" />

<br>
<br>

Build a solid foundation and the right mindset in embedded systems development.  
Focus on bare-metal development, core embedded concepts and low-level peripheral access.

You’ll learn:
- Embedded systems fundamentals (MCU vs MPU, sensors, actuators)
- How to read datasheets and reference manuals
- Bare-metal peripheral configuration (GPIO, UART, ADC, Timers, Interrupts, I2C, SPI)
- The embedded build process, toolchain, and debugging basics
- Industry workflows and mindset (Git, Agile/SCRUM, V-cycle)

##

**[Advanced Level](https://github.com/Embedded-Systems-Hub/EMBEDDED-ROADMAP-Advanced)**

<img width="500" height="630" alt="EMBEDDED-ROADMAP-Advanced" src="https://github.com/Embedded-Systems-Hub/.github/blob/main/assets/embedded-roadmap-advanced.png" />

<br>
<br>

Move from “working code” to scalable and maintainable embedded software architectures.  
Focus on design decisions, modularity, and workflows used in real embedded projects.

You’ll learn:
- Performance, constraints, and design trade-offs in embedded systems
- Architecture vs microarchitecture and their impact on software design
- Modular firmware architecture and clean code organization
- State machines and control logic design
- Defensive programming and robust error handling
- Advanced peripherals and data handling (PWM, DMA)
- Professional tooling and workflows (CMake, Docker, CI/CD with GitHub Actions)

##

**[Expert Level](https://github.com/Embedded-Systems-Hub/EMBEDDED-ROADMAP-Expert)**

<img width="500" height="630" alt="EMBEDDED-ROADMAP-Expert" src="https://github.com/Embedded-Systems-Hub/.github/blob/main/assets/embedded-roadmap-expert.png" />

<br>
<br>

Master real-time, reliable, and production-grade systems.  
Focus on RTOS-based designs, robustness, timing constraints, and industry-level practices.

## 🔥 Monthly Challenges

Monthly, hands-on challenges designed to **learn by doing** and grow together as embedded engineers.

Each challenge:
- Focuses on a practical, industry-relevant skill
- Can be completed without special hardware whenever possible
- Encourages sharing solutions, approaches and questions
- Includes a follow-up explanation and discussion

The goal is to get **hands-on with useful embedded technologies**, explore different approaches and learn from each other.

**Current challenges:**
- **[Challenge #1 - QEMU & Debugging](https://github.com/Embedded-Systems-Hub/Challenges/tree/main/ch001-qemu-stm32vldiscovery-uart):** Emulation-based development and debugging workflows
- **[Challenge #2 - Sections & Memory Layout](https://github.com/Embedded-Systems-Hub/Challenges/tree/main/ch002-sections-memory-layout):** Understanding binaries, linker outputs, and memory organization
- **[Challenge #3 - FreeRTOS Tasks](https://github.com/Embedded-Systems-Hub/Challenges/tree/main/ch003-FreeRTOS-tasks):** FreeRTOS task creation, priorities, scheduling behavior, and real-time analysis using SEGGER SystemView
